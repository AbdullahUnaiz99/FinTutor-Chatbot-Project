The formulas for a regular annuity and per-\\npetuity also follow from the formula if we let the growth rate g = 0. So, if you remember \\nthe growing annuity formula, you’ve got them all!\\nThis example involves a 30-year growing annuity, with a growth rate of 5%, and an initial cash \\nflow of $10,000. The present value of this growing annuity is given by\\n PV = $10,000 *\\n1\\n0.10 - 0.05 ¢1 - a 1.05\\n1.10 b\\n30\\n≤\\n = $10,000 * 15.0463\\n = $150,463 today'),\n",
